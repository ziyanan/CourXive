# CourXive

Courvie is a platform that offers online learning navigation for online courses' comparisons and recommendations. We aim at helping integrating studying materials and online courses through various learning websites. No matter you are a student at school, a professional employee, or an individual learning lover, there is no need to worry about looking around for learning websites separately.
